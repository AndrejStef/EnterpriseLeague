                    <p>In order to unleash your employees’ full potential, you must give them responsibilities. Allocate each employee processes which they own and manage independently. Your role will be to provide them with guidance and be available for consultations. Therefore giving them a sense of ownership and responsibility will enable them to grow in their role quicker and more successfully. It will challenge their&nbsp;time management&nbsp;and organizational skills but with time and perseverance, they will acquire skills that won’t come from micromanagement.

                    <h5>Ways to cut overhead costs</h5>
                    <p>Review your marketing mix [and] compare how much you are spending and gaining from each channel. If, for example, you are investing a lot in PR … but you don’t see a significant increase in your website traffic, it is very likely that you are targeting the wrong marketing channel.

The main reasoning behind this type of outfit is to wear something that isn’t tight and makes you feel uncomfortable, that you cannot wait to take off after work.

                  <p>London, UK, December 30th, 2020</p>
                  <p class="text-start">
                    Another year is drawing to a close; and we once again find ourselves planning for the future, but also reflecting on the events of 2020 – we hope that despite the difficulties and uncertainty this year has brought, you have managed to stay strong and focused on the things you can control.
                    <span id="dots"></span><span id="more">In that manner, Enterprise League has continued to work hard on connecting businesses worldwide. Our focus has always been to bring more business opportunities to small businesses. Thus, seeing how severely they suffered due to the pandemic, our drive to improve the platform, and provide them with better solutions, only grew stronger.
    
                      Thanks to nearly 100k new companies that joined the platform (a big milestone for us!) we got an unprecedented growth momentum which consequently brought us a humbling number of opportunities.
                      
                      This success didn’t pass unrecognised – we had the privilege of being named as one of the best business platforms by the Business Insider.
                      
                      Lead by the same currents of growth, this year we have formed deeper relationships with both new and old users, expanded our partners’ circle, and scaled our team.
                      
                      As we reflect, we think about who we are and who we want to be, both personally and as a company. A commitment to quality and value is one of our fundamental business principles, we firmly believe in excelling in what we promise and deliver.
                      
                      What we’re most proud of this year is that we’ve managed to provide the same high level of service and solutions to all companies, regardless of their background. Given that, we seek to make our solutions easily accessible – keeping the lines of communication open in order to help our users with their platform experience. We are committed to combine courage and wisdom to move forward; confidently pursuing growth and investment while not abandoning our values.
                      
                      It is our hope that these things have all been clearly evident in the past year, and that they continue into the future. Finally, we once again express our sincere appreciation to all of our users, readers and collaborators; wishing you and your families a bright hopeful start to 2021.
